## How to Use

You can browse through the folders in this repository to find the JavaScript files corresponding to specific problems. Each problem typically includes a JavaScript file with the solution and a README.md file explaining the problem statement, approach, and code explanation.

To run any of the JavaScript solutions, you will need to have Node.js installed on your machine. You can execute the code using the following command:

```bash
